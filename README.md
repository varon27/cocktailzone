Cocktailzone
=========

A Symfony 4 project created on February 20, 2018.

Cocktailzone is my first project with Symfony 4 and Webpack for front design.

Simple but efficient, the website hooked theCocktailDB API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to allow cocktails searches: 
- by ingredient
- by cocktail's name
- randomly 

Cheers and don't forget : 
- *the one who drives is the one who doesn't drink*
- *alcohol is bad for health, drink moderately*
